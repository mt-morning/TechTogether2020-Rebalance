# Submission for TechTogether 2020 Boston: Rebalance

https://devpost.com/software/rebalance-i4zljs

## Inspiration
With how easy it can be to track device usage, we were inspired to create a way for people to track their personal time spent. Similar journaling apps exist, but are often very individualized. We find that apps that integrate community sharing aspects (such as sharing goal completion) encourage user retention. 
## What it does
Shifts the focus from work-oriented planners and productivity apps to a more holistic view of what a productive work-life balance means. Users can define what productivity means to them, track times for their inserted work/life activities, and share what they did on a community page with other users.
## How we built it
We started by discussing what a "productive work-life balance" entails and determined that a reframing of what "productivity" means is key to how we designed our application. We decided that the community-sharing aspect is a vital feature because it would inspire users to complete and share their goals, as well as redefining what is a "sharable" goal. 
Following this shared vision, we started developing a prototype in Figma using Material Design icons and inspiration drawn from Pinterest.
## Challenges we ran into
In deciding what functionality we want to support, we had to determine if this application would be more useful as a web application or a mobile application. Additionally, since none of us are familiar with mobile application development, we ultimately decided to focus on developing a prototype rather than jumping into development with Android Studio. 
Finally, half of the team is in IST and half of the team is in EST, so communication over the time difference was a bit harder to coordinate. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new software (Figma), gathering requirements, learning about basic mobile application development.
## What we learned
Requirements engineering is hard! But valuable as it helped us determine what visual form our application might take and what functionalities are important for us to focus on.
## What's next for Rebalance
- implementing our Figma-built prototype into a publishable Android application with a connected database to store users
